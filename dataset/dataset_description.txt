CONTEXT
The Iowa Department of Commerce requires that every store that sells alcohol in bottled form for off-the-premises consumption must hold a class "E" liquor license (an arrangement typical of most of the state alcohol regulatory bodies). All alcoholic sales made by stores registered thusly with the Iowa Department of Commerce are logged in the Commerce department system, which is in turn published as open data by the State of Iowa.

CONTENT
This dataset contains information on the name, kind, price, quantity, and location of sale of sales of individual containers or packages of containers of alcoholic beverages.
